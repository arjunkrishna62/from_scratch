# LLM From Scratch 🚀

A simplified implementation of the **Transformer** architecture ("Attention Is All You Need") from scratch in Python using **PyTorch**, built as part of my Master’s research projects.

## 📘 Overview

This project implements:

- **Multi-head self-attention**
- **Position-wise feed-forward networks**
- **Sinusoidal positional encodings**
- **Encoder and decoder stacks**
- **Beam search decoding**

It trains a Transformer model for **language modeling** and **classification/instruction-following** tasks — all without using high‑level libraries like Hugging Face.

## 🚧 Motivation

- Reinforce understanding of core Transformer components (attention, residuals, layer norm).
- Learn how training loops, batching, masking, and decoding work under the hood.
- Bridge theory and code by building from the ground up.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjunkrishna62/from_scratch.git
cd from_scratch
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
